# CW_React-Native_Project

==============
## A coding challenge to to learn CW's full stack.
==============

A simple mobile app that displays a scrolling list of users retrieved from a server.

On pressing an item, a details page containing the users profile image, their age, how long until their next birthday and their rating appears.

On pressing ```Edit```, ```Save``` and ```cancel``` buttons appear as well as ```+``` and ```-``` buttons.
These allow you to increment or decrement the users rating.
If ```Save``` pressed, the new value is persisted to the database.
If ```Cancel``` pressed, the rating reverts to it's previous value.

The server for this app is in a separate repository:
